## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Here is some random maths: $x^2$ and some more:
\begin{align*}
x &= 1\\
y &= 2\\
z &= 3
\end{align*}

%This will not be rendered in the html though!
You can put quite a lot of raw \LaTeX in here and have it delivered safely to the \LaTeX output and the PDF output.

You can do the same with raw html but this will be rendered, badly, in the PDF

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $\$1600$ |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $\$12$ |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $\$1$ |

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
```{r mtcars$mpg-setup}
library(BrailleR)
library(ggplot2)
stuff=VI(hist(mtcars$mpg))
```


```{r mtcars$mpg, out.extra=paste("alt='",stuff,"'")}
hist(mtcars$mpg)
```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
{sink(file="vanilla.txt")
2+3
somedata=rnorm(10)
VI(hist(somedata))
sink()}
```
